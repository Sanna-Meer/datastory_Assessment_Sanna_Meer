<p>Have you ever wondered what pushes people to pursue a PhD? According to the Guardian, most people start a PhD because of their thirst for knowledge. However, there are other opportunities to drive research projects outside academia. Sometimes having obtained a PhD provides access to these research opportunities.</p>
<p>USA ranks first in academic education which also motivates and pushes hoards of international students to pursue excellence and PhD’s in that country (The Guardian, 2012).</p>
<p>There are other reasons that motivate students to continue their education to PhD level. Harking back to a time when these diplomas were reserved for a minuscule segment of the population, the doctoral degree is a seen as a prestige marker, the recognition of one’s exceptional talents and the certificate of belonging to the intellectual elite. The non-material rewards that a PhD is supposed to bring, at least theoretically, are connected to social standing; PhDs can be used as a vehicle for upwards social mobility, and for the fulfillment of personal and family ambitions. (The Guardian, 2012)</p>

<p>From the graph <a href="#fig-trendp">Figure&nbsp;2</a> , we can see the overall trend of the PhD’s awarded in USA over the years 2008-2017 by the broad field. Although , it is generally an upward trend for most of the fields, we can see that for the <strong>Education</strong> field, there has been an exponential fall in the PhD’s awarded specifically from 2008 to 2011 there was a drastic drop. Why did this happen? let us try to understand this in a bit more detail.</p>
<section id="why-did-education-phds-fall" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-did-education-phds-fall">Why did Education PhDs fall?</h4>
<p>Experts say the structure of the American higher education system could be the cause according to (Education,2019). And as a growing number of people seek graduate degrees, many more companies are favoring those people for employment.</p>
<p>In the past, most doctoral students entered postdoctoral positions. In these positions, they would usually do research in their fields while also teaching. This has long been the first step toward being chosen for a tenured position, one in which a college or university offers a lifetime position for teaching and research.</p>
<p><img src="03-figures/edu.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The case of the Education, this has changed over the last 30 years. There has been a move away from the teaching fields towards STEM fields because of the belief that they lead to better paying jobs. As a result, colleges and universities are employing fewer education professors (Education,2019).</p>

<p>From the graph <a href="#fig-line">Figure&nbsp;3</a>, it is evident that throughout these years, <strong>Life sciences field has the most PhD’s</strong>. It has consistently dominated the PhD market in USA whereas <strong>Engineering has been consistently low</strong>.</p>
<p>One particular year alone, American colleges and universities awarded 12,781 PhDs in the life sciences—about 23% of all doctorates awarded in the US that year. However according to Areo , This is unsustainable: the market simply cannot absorb that many PhD graduates. And yet, this reality may not have sunk in for the latest batch of students. In a 2019 Nature survey of graduate students in STEM fields around the globe, 56% picked academia as their first-choice career.</p>

<p>From the graph <a href="#fig-lifesc">Figure&nbsp;4</a>, we can see that <strong>Biological and Biomedical sciences</strong> in the Life sciences field has been consistently getting the highest PhD’s.</p>
<p>The explosive increase in the number of postdocs in biomedical fields is puzzling for many science policymakers. PhDs in biomedical fields has increased over time, and it is estimated that there is approximately only one tenure-track position in the US for every 6.3 PhD graduates, which means the rest need to get jobs outside academia or stay in lower-paid temporary positions (Ghaffarzadegan, 2021)</p>

<p>Looking at Engineering which is on the other end of the spectrum :</p>
<p>For engineers, unemployment numbers are back to what they were before the recession hit in 2008, according to IEEE Spectrum. Unemployment was 1.8% in pre-recession October 2008, and 2.8% in recession-encumbered October 2010. As an aside, the numbers uncannily mirror the aftermath of the dot-com bubble. In April 2001, before the worst of the bust, unemployment was 1.7%, but it had increased to 2.7% in October 2003.</p>

<p>The table <a href="#fig-eng">Figure&nbsp;5</a> above shows the field in engineering that has the most to least PhD’s. <strong>Computer Science</strong> has the highest PhD’s , which is not surprising as Silicon Valley in the US has tech giants with enough workforce opportunities in that domain.<br>
Towards the least side, we see that <strong>Communication Engineering</strong> has the lowest PhD’s awarded. On further research, it is found that in the US, the average salary of a communication engineer is far lower than any other engineering discipline. This can be one of the reasons for the low PhD persuasion in this field. However, we can safely say that there is a shortage of engineering doctrates in the US.</p>

<p>In the <a href="#fig-psy">Figure&nbsp;6</a> above, we can see that in the broad field of Psychology and Social Sciences, the <strong>Psychology</strong> major has the highest number of PhD’s. This is also an indication that more people might be becoming aware of mental health and want to gain further knowledge into understanding the same.<br>
Another interesting thing is that after <em>the Covid-19 pandemic hit</em>, the importance and attention towards Mental Wellness has increased drastically and more people have become aware about mental well-being throughout the world.</p>

<p><a href="#fig-math">Figure&nbsp;7</a> above shows the yearly breakdown of the Mathematics PhD based on the majors. As is evident, <strong>Computer and Information sciences</strong> has been dominating the PhD game since 2008 and is consistently higher than Mathematics and Statistics major in terms of the PhDs awarded in the major. One of the reasons for this dominance is the technological boom where all the students are catapulted towards the Computer and Tech related courses for pursuing a PhD.</p>

<h1>Conclusion :</h1>
<p>Overall, from the summaries and trends above, it is evident that although PhDs are a highly coveted degree in the United States, however, one cannot ignore that the standards of the universities are getting higher and the people enrolling in the Doctorates programmes is on the decline as well. The question isn’t “why” , but the question lies in “what” can be done to improve the condition , specially when we talk about certain majors loosing the sheen of their PhD numbers.</p>
